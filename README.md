### Dynast.io
Dynast.io is a community and platform focused on gaming, creation, and collaborative competition. It provides the ecosystem, rules, and infrastructure that the Discord server follows, including channels, events, leaderboards, and integrations with external services. Dynast.io acts as the governance and vision center — setting community standards, publishing updates, and coordinating with the team that runs the server.

### Admins
**Admins** are the server’s senior operators and policy owners. They are responsible for:
- Enforcing server-wide rules and making final decisions on escalations.
- Managing roles, permissions, and server configuration.
- Approving or revoking moderator actions and performing high-impact operations (ban appeals, server audit, token rotation).
- Coordinating with Dynast.io product and community teams for announcements, events, and major policy changes.

Admins must be impartial, documented in decisions, and maintain an audit trail for important actions.

### Moderators
**Moderators** (the Moderaots) are the frontline community guardians responsible for daily moderation tasks:
- Monitoring chat channels for rule violations (spam, harassment, illegal content, exploitation).
- Issuing warnings, short timeouts, kicks, and escalations to admins for severe or repeat offenses.
- Managing report queues, helping users, and documenting incidents with clear evidence (timestamps, message links).
- Applying temporary sanctions and guiding community members toward acceptable behavior.

Moderators must act consistently, avoid public disputes with members, and always record actions in moderation logs to keep accountability.

### Youtubers
**Youtubers** in Dynast.io are content creators who amplify the community and create tutorials, highlights, and promotional materials:
- They should follow the same community guidelines as members and disclose promotions or sponsorships.
- They collaborate with admins and moderators for events, giveaways, and recorded matches to ensure consent and rule compliance.
- When streaming or recording, they coordinate with moderation to prevent griefing and to respect privacy and participant consent.

Youtubers are community ambassadors; their behavior reflects on Dynast.io and must align with the server’s code of conduct.

### Developers
**Developers** maintain Dynast.io’s technical systems, bots, and integrations:
- They are responsible for the bot code, deployment pipelines, API integrations (leaderboards, webhooks), and operational security.
- Developers work with admins to handle incidents that require code changes or token rotations and provide safe tools for moderators (moderation panels, evidence exports).
- They should follow secure practices: never expose tokens publicly, provide role-based access to tooling, and log privileged operations.

Developers must prioritize reliability, observability, and secure defaults for all community-facing systems.

### Moderation in the Dynastio Discord Server
Moderation at Dynastio is structured, transparent, and community-centered:
- Policy: Clear rules are published and pinned; expectations are proactive and include prohibited content, harassment rules, and dispute resolution steps.
- Triage: Reports are triaged by moderators; low-risk issues are handled directly, higher-risk incidents are escalated to admins with documented context.
- Actions: Sanctions are graduated (warning → timeout → kick → ban) and applied consistently. Temporary measures are preferred when appropriate, with clear instructions for appeal.
- Evidence: Every action includes a log entry with who acted, why, and links/screenshots where possible to ensure auditability.
- Communication: Moderators issue public or private notices as needed, explain decisions concisely, and direct members to appeal channels when available.
- Tools & Automation: Bots assist with rate-limiting, spam detection, and evidence capture, but human judgement governs complex or borderline cases.
- Training & Review: Moderators receive guidelines and regular reviews; admins audit moderation logs and run periodic consistency checks.
- Safety & Respect: The top priority is member safety; moderation balances community health with freedom of expression, enforcing rules while preserving a welcoming environment.

This layered approach ensures Dynastio remains vibrant, safe, and fair — combining automated tools, trained moderators, responsible admins, supportive developers, and content creators who uphold the community values.
