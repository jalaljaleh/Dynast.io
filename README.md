## 🚀 About the Project

Dynast.io is a real‑time multiplayer survival game. While the official team has not published a public API reference, the community has reverse‑engineered and wrapped parts of the game’s backend to make it easier to build tools and integrations.

This repository collects:
- 📦 API wrappers (e.g. [.NET client Dynastio.Net](https://github.com/jalaljaleh/Dynastio.Net))  
- 📊 Example scripts for fetching player stats, leaderboards, and server info  
- 🛠️ Documentation of known endpoints and data structures  
- 🤝 Guides for building bots, dashboards, or overlays
